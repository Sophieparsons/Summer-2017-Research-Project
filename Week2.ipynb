    "    If the original MIP is unsolvavble, Gurobi relaxes the MIP by removing the integrality restrictions. It then solves the problem. \n",
    "    If this solution does not satisfy the original integrality restrictions, then standard procedure is to pick some variable that is restricted to be a fractional integer.\n",
    "    It then solved for the lower and uper bounds of the fractional integer (ie x =5.7, it would solve for x<=5, x>=6)\n",
    "    This continues, each time selecting \"branching variables\" the generated MIPs are called the \"nodes of the tree\" and P0, the original relaxation,is the root node.\n",
    "Fathomed and Incumbent nodes:\n",
    "    If all of the integrality restrictions of the original MIP are satisfied at a node, then we first designate the node as \"fathomed\"\n",
    "    The best integer solution found is called the incumbent, if the integer feasible solution just found has a better objective function value than the current incumbent, it becomes the new incumbent\n",
    "    A node can also be fathomed if the branch that led to the current node added a restriction that made the LP relaxation infeasible\n",
    "    Or if an optimal relaxation solution is found, but its objective value is bigger than that of the current incumbent\n",
    "Best Bound and Gap\n",

    "            I.E. it may be that many of the integer variables have values that are quite close to integral. We could round some of them to their nearby values, fix them to these values, solve the resulting LP relaxation, and repeatin the hopes that all integer variables will fall into line. \n",
    "                If they do, and if the resulting feasible has a better objective value than the current incumbent, we replace that incumbent and proceed."
